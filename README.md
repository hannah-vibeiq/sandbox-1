2. [casey](#casey)
3. [ELIZABETH](#elizabeth)

## hannah
In the table of contents, the bracket link and the hashtag link need to be adjacent (no space in between)
## casey
There does need to be parantheses around the hashtag
## elizabeth
I don't think these are case-sensitive but I want to test again
